= 0.7.0 / 10 Sep 2012

  * Rename Renderer => Writer.
  * Allow partials to be loaded dynamically using a callback (thanks @TiddoLangerak
    for the suggestion).
  * Fixed a bug with higher-order sections that prevented them from being
    passed the raw text of the section from the original template.
  * More concise token format. Tokens also include start/end indices in the
    original template.
  * High-level API is consistent with the Writer API.
  * Allow partials to be passed to the pre-compiled function (thanks @fallenice).
  * Don't use eval (thanks @cweider).

  * Use JavaScript's definition of falsy when determining whether to render an
    inverted section or not. Issue #186.
  * Use Mustache.escape to escape values inside {{}}. This function may be
    reassigned to alter the default escaping behavior. Issue #244.
  * Fixed a bug that clashed with QUnit (thanks @kannix).
  * Added volo support (thanks @guybedford).
